## Choosing colormaps

Although this might seem like a trivial, style based, decision; the truth is that it can have drastic effects on the readers interpretation. If you want more information on why this is so important you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) presentation. I will not reiterate the content of their presentation, but I will say that you should consider the information you are presenting when you choose your colormaps. For example, if you have two unique distributions, you will probably want to use a `diverging` colormaps. You can find all the colormaps and information about when to use them [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html).
